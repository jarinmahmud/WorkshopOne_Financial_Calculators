    - Outputs
    - Print to CLI the result of calculation
- Creating a calculator // Creating an interface for a user // Create a menu with user input // Add, sub, div, multi
  methods

### Do it! / Code!

### Look back

- Optimizing/refactoring

# Workflow:

- Ask prompt for which calculator to use
- set case for showing the calculator to take number input
- create separate method for each calculator
    - each method wil take inputs to calculate by using CLI prompt
    - calculate the output
    - close out
- push code to github
